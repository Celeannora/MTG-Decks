# Local Deck-Building Workflow

This guide is for users who want to run the full AI-assisted deck-building process **on their own machine** — useful when your AI tool has limited tool access, rate limits, or no ability to run scripts directly.

The key idea: **everything goes into a single `session.md` file.** No scattered outputs, no lost context between tool calls. One file in, one file out.

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Celeannora/MTG-Decks.git
cd MTG-Decks

# Install dependencies (just `requests`)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify the card database exists
ls cards_by_category/
# Should show: artifact/ creature/ enchantment/ instant/ land/ planeswalker/ sorcery/ etc.

# If the database is missing or outdated, regenerate it:
python scripts/fetch_and_categorize_cards.py
```

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Generate a session scaffold

**Interactive mode (recommended)** — just run with no arguments and follow the prompts:

```bash
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py
```

Or use the CLI flags directly:

```bash
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py \
  --name "Orzhov Lifegain" \
  --colors WB \
  --archetype lifegain
```

This does three things:
1. Runs all relevant `search_cards.py` queries for your archetype
2. Embeds the complete candidate pool (every card result) into a single `session.md`
3. Creates the deck folder with empty templates for `decklist.txt`, `analysis.md`, and `sideboard_guide.md`

Output:
```
Decks/2026-04-03_Orzhov_Lifegain/
├── session.md            ← All your work goes here
├── decklist.txt          ← Empty (fill during Gate 3)
├── analysis.md           ← Template (compile after all gates)
└── sideboard_guide.md    ← Template (fill after Gate 5)
```

### Step 2: Feed session.md to your AI tool

Attach `session.md` to your AI tool. Then use the prompt template below.

#### Standard prompt (no tribe constraint)

```
Read AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md from https://github.com/Celeannora/MTG-Decks.
A session.md is attached. Acknowledge Mode B and continue from the first
incomplete gate. Only use cards from the Gate 1 candidate pool in session.md.
Cite the source file for every card you select.
```

#### Tribal deck prompt

```
Read AI_INSTRUCTIONS.md from https://github.com/Celeannora/MTG-Decks.
A session.md is attached. Acknowledge Mode B and continue from the first
incomplete gate. The deck's tribe constraint is [Dog / Angel] — enforce it
as a hard requirement in Gate 3. Every creature must be that type or a
Changeling. Only use cards from the Gate 1 candidate pool. Cite the source
file for every card you select.
```

> Replace `[Dog / Angel]` with the tribe(s) from the **Archetype** line at
> the top of session.md.

#### If you also have a synergy_report.md

Attach it alongside session.md and add this line to your prompt:

```
A synergy_report.md is also attached. Use it as a reference when completing
Gate 2.5 in session.md, but fill in the Gate 2.5 section yourself — do not
treat the report as a substitute for that work.
```

> **Do not attach synergy_report.md without session.md.** The report has no
> meaning without the candidate pool and gate structure in session.md.

### Step 3: Fill in gates inside session.md

Work through the gates in order. All work stays in `session.md`:

| Gate | What happens |
|------|-------------|
| Gate 1 | Already done — candidate pool is embedded. Run extra queries if needed. |
| Gate 2 | Define strategy, win condition, target turn. |
| Gate 2.5 | Score synergies, map chains, check thresholds. |
| Gate 3 | Select all 60 mainboard cards with source citations. |
| Gate 4 | Build mana base. Run `mana_base_advisor.py --pips W:N,B:N --lands N` to validate source counts. |
| Gate 5 | Select 15 sideboard cards. Run `sideboard_advisor.py --meta aggro control mill` for suggestions. |
| Gate 6 | Run validation script and record the result. |

### Step 4: Run validation

```bash
# Default — reads cards_by_category/ CSVs directly (no extra setup)
python scripts/validate_decklist.py Decks/2026-04-03_Orzhov_Lifegain/decklist.txt --verbose

# With synergy tag summary and land-count sanity check
python scripts/validate_decklist.py Decks/2026-04-03_Orzhov_Lifegain/decklist.txt --strict --show-tags

# Faster offline backends (run build_local_database.py first)
python scripts/validate_decklist.py --db json Decks/2026-04-03_Orzhov_Lifegain/decklist.txt
python scripts/validate_decklist.py --db sqlite Decks/2026-04-03_Orzhov_Lifegain/decklist.txt
```

Paste the output into the "Validation Output" section of `session.md`.

### Step 5: Finalize output files

Copy the completed work from `session.md` into:
- `decklist.txt` — MTGA-importable list
- `analysis.md` — Full analysis following the template
- `sideboard_guide.md` — Matchup boarding plans

---

## Additional Analysis Tools

### Mana Base Validation (Gate 4 support)

```bash
# Count colored pips in your mainboard first, then run:
python scripts/mana_base_advisor.py --pips W:12,B:8 --lands 24
python scripts/mana_base_advisor.py --pips W:12,B:8,R:6 --lands 24 --on-draw
```

Outputs: minimum sources per color (Karsten-based), Monte Carlo access probabilities by turn,
recommended land allocation. Run BEFORE finalizing lands.

### Curve Execution Check (after Gate 3)

```bash
python scripts/goldfish.py Decks/my_deck/decklist.txt
python scripts/goldfish.py Decks/my_deck/decklist.txt --hands 2000 --turns 5 --focus "Key Card Name"
```

Simulates opening hands to verify your curve executes. Reports: land drought/flood rate,
on-curve probability, and how early key cards appear. If on-curve drops below 40%, revisit
your CMC distribution before gate 4.

### Sideboard Planning (Gate 5 support)

```bash
python scripts/sideboard_advisor.py Decks/my_deck/decklist.txt --meta aggro control mill
python scripts/sideboard_advisor.py --colors WB --meta aggro graveyard stax
```

Queries the local DB for sideboard candidates by matchup. Use the output as a starting
shortlist — then verify each selection against Gate 1 pool rules (must be in the database).

### Power Score Filtering (Gate 1 pool thinning)

After running queries, use --ranked and --min-power to thin large candidate pools:

```bash
# Get top 30 lifegain creatures by power score
python scripts/search_cards.py --type creature --colors WB --tags lifegain --ranked --limit 30

# Exclude weak cards (score < 1.5)
python scripts/search_cards.py --type creature --colors WB --tags lifegain --min-power 1.5
```

This cuts 200-card pools to the 30-50 strongest candidates before synergy analysis.

### Format Legality Filtering

```bash
# Standard-legal only (requires rebuilt database)
python scripts/search_cards.py --type creature --colors WB --tags lifegain --legal standard

# Rebuild database with legality data:
python scripts/fetch_and_categorize_cards.py
```

Note: `--legal` requires the database to be rebuilt after updating `fetch_and_categorize_cards.py`.

## Scaffold Options

### All archetypes

```bash
# Aggro
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Boros Aggro" --colors WR --archetype aggro

# Midrange
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Golgari Midrange" --colors BG --archetype midrange

# Control
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Azorius Control" --colors WU --archetype control

# Combo
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Jeskai Combo" --colors WUR --archetype combo

# Mill
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Dimir Mill" --colors UB --archetype mill

# Lifegain
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Orzhov Lifegain" --colors WB --archetype lifegain

# Tribal — single tribe
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Simic Frogs" --colors GU --archetype tribal --tribe Frog

# Tribal — multiple tribes (generates one query per type)
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Orzhov Dog Angel" --colors WB --archetype tribal --tribe Dog Angel

# Tribal — with guaranteed focus cards
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Orzhov Dog Angel" --colors WB \
  --archetype tribal --tribe Dog Angel \
  --focus-cards "Resplendent Angel" "Wary Watchdog" "Prideful Feastling"

# Ramp
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Gruul Ramp" --colors RG --archetype ramp

# Tempo
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Izzet Tempo" --colors UR --archetype tempo

# Burn
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py --name "Mono Red Burn" --colors R --archetype burn
```

### Offline mode (no queries)

If you don't have the card database yet or want a blank template:

```bash
python scripts/generate_deck_scaffold.py \
  --name "My Deck" --colors WB --archetype lifegain --skip-queries
```

This generates the full scaffold structure with placeholder query sections. You run the queries manually and paste the results in.

### Additional flags

```bash
--date 2026-04-01                      # Override date (default: today)
--output-dir ./my_decks                # Custom output directory
--extra-tags draw,etb                  # Add extra search tags to all queries
--tribe Angel Dog                      # One or more creature subtypes (tribal)
--focus-cards "Resplendent Angel" \
              "Wary Watchdog"          # Guarantee specific cards in the pool
```

**`--tribe` with multiple types** generates one creature query per type
(e.g. `--tribe Dog Angel` → separate Dog query + separate Angel query).
This avoids the broken `Dog|Angel` oracle-text OR syntax.

**`--focus-cards`** appends a `--name` lookup for each named card at the
end of the query plan. Useful for key cards that archetype queries might
miss (e.g. Changelings, multi-type creatures, specific legendaries).

---

## Running Additional Queries

If the initial queries don't cover what you need, run more manually:

```bash
# Example: find creatures with ETB effects
python scripts/search_cards.py --type creature --colors WB --tags etb --show-tags

# Example: find cheap counterspells
python scripts/search_cards.py --type instant --colors WB --tags counter --cmc-max 2 --show-tags

# Example: find a specific card
python scripts/search_cards.py --name "Sheoldred"
```

Paste the full output into the "Additional Queries" section of `session.md`.

## Why a Single File?

AI tools with limited context or tool access work best when everything is in one place:

1. **No lost context** — The candidate pool, strategy decisions, and card selections all live together. The AI doesn't need to "remember" what happened in a previous tool call.

2. **Auditable** — Every decision traces back to a query result visible in the same file. You can review the entire chain from "candidate found" to "card selected" in one scroll.

3. **Portable** — `session.md` works with any AI tool: ChatGPT, Claude, local LLMs, Copilot. Paste it in and start working. No plugin or API access required.

4. **Recoverable** — If your session is interrupted, everything is saved. Resume exactly where you left off.

5. **Consolidated output** — Instead of the AI generating files across multiple tool calls (which can fail, conflict, or get lost), everything lands in one file that you then split into the final outputs yourself.

---

## Troubleshooting

**"cards_by_category/ not found"**
```bash
python scripts/fetch_and_categorize_cards.py
```
This downloads ~100 MB from Scryfall and rebuilds the database. Requires internet access.

**"No cards matched the given filters"**
Try broadening your query. Remove `--tags` or `--cmc-max` constraints. Check that `--colors` uses the right letters (W/U/B/R/G).

**Validation fails with illegal cards**
The card is not in the database (rotated, banned, or misspelled). Check the "Did you mean?" suggestions. Only cards in `cards_by_category/` are legal.

**Session file is too large for my AI tool**
Use `--skip-queries` to generate a blank scaffold, then run queries individually and paste only the relevant results. Or use `--format names` with `search_cards.py` for compact output.
